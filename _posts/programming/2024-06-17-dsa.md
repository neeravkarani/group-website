There is a lot of fuss around coding interviews, particularly in the research (PhD / postdoc) crowd seeking to move to industry. In my experience, getting comfortable with the following topics should provide a 95% coverage of questions that may be asked for research scientist or similar roles.

### Data Structures

#### Linear DS
- Arrays
- Strings
- Stacks
- Queues

#### Hashmaps, Hashsets

#### Graphs
- Linked lists
- Binary trees
- Grids
- Heaps

### Algorithms

#### Linear DS
- Two pointers (general)
- Two pointers (sliding window)
- Two pointers (binary search)

#### Graphs
- Traversal (depth-first)
- Traversal (breadth-first)

### Areas Needing More Practice

Here are the remaining bits that need much more practice, and are highly unlikely to show up in real interviews (again, for research scientist positions).

### Data Structures

- Binary search trees
- Tries

### Algorithms

#### Linear DS
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming
- Sorting

#### Graphs
- Backtracking
- Topological sort

#### Misc
- Bit manipulation
- Math
