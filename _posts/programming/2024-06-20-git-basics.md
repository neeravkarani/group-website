## Introduction

### Git
 - 'git init': Initializes git in a new directory / repository. Now, the contents of this repo can be tracked.
 - 'git add .': Saves all files in the repo.
 - 'git commit -m "message"': Describes the changes made in the last save.
 - 'git log': Gives a log of all the commits made so far.
 - 'git checkout commit_name': brings back the state of the repo to how it was in that commit.
